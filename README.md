A simple web forum that allows users to communicate by creating topics and leaving comments under them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
### Backend:
* **Python**, **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Alembic**, **PyJWT**, **Pydantic**, **Passlib**, **PostgreSQL**

## üì¶ Installation and launch
* **With docker**:

```docker compose up```

## üöÄ Functionality
* **Registration and login**:

Registration is done by username, email and password.

Login is possible by email/username and password.

Passwords are stored in the database only in hashed form.

After successful login, the user is issued a JWT token with a limited validity period, which is saved in a cookie and used for further authentication.

* **Topics and comments**:

Authorized users can create new topics and leave comments.

The user can edit and delete their own topics and comments.

* **Search**:

A search by topics using keywords in the title is implemented.

* **User page**:

From any topic, you can go to its author's page.

The page displays: username, registration date, user about information, list of all topics created by the user.

If the user has not filled in information about themselves, a standard placeholder text is displayed.

* **Editing a profile**:

The user can change all the data specified during registration: name, e-mail, password and additional information.

When changing the user name or e-mail, a uniqueness check is performed: if the data is already used by another user, updating is impossible.
